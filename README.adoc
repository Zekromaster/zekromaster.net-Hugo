This is a simple static website made with Hugo.

In the future, I will write a software for pulling part of the contents of the
`data` directory from my own Solid POD at build time, and I shall set automatic
rebuild whenever the data changes up. This will allow, for instance, to avoid
hardcoding of "games.json". The data files that should be loaded from the pod in
the future are already located in "data/pod", and a "build.sh" file already
exists to house the build script in the future.

I also have an "asciidoctor" script already in place. For now I don't need it,
but it allows me to manage Hugo's asciidoctor's arguments, for instance to use
additional modules.

them, but are licensed under CC-BY too.
